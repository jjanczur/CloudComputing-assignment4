discussion.txt

Run your programs with different job configurations:
- Different numbers of iterations or clusters for k-means
- Different initial placements

Write a few sentences in the file discussion.txt about the configurations you have tried and what you have observed regarding the run time and results of the jobs.

Answer the following questions separately for both programs:
1. Which steps in your program require communication and synchronization between your workers?

2. What resources are your programs bound by? Memory? CPU? Network? Disk?

3. Could you improve the partitioning of your data to yield better run-time?
