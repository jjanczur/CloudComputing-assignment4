Run your programs with different job configurations:
Two worker nodes
#WordCount

Parallelism: 1 -> execution time: 8
Parallelism: 2 -> execution time: 11
Parallelism: 4 -> execution time: 22

#CellCluster (berlin)

Parallelism: 1 -> execution time: 18
Parallelism: 2 -> execution time: 11
Parallelism: 4 -> execution time: 22


Parallelism set to 2 performed the best. 
That is why the following tests are going to be conducted using parallelism set ot 2.

Answer the following questions separately for both programs:
1. Which steps in your program require communication and synchronization between your workers?

Answers are based the flink web console
#WordCount.java
	Communication: between GroupCombine - GroupReduce, Sort-Partition - Data Sink.
	Synchronisation: is required while we are receiving the data. One Worker synchronization.

#CellCluster.java
	Communication: all steps
	Synchronisation: writing the output, while finding the first centroid in GroupReduce

2. What resources are your programs bound by? Memory? CPU? Network? Disk?

#WordCount.java
	Network - reading data from s3 bucket is the longest execution step in an optimal parallelism mode (2). It goes through the network. 

#CellCluster.java 
	CPU - in contrast to WordCount reading data from s3 bucket was the shortest execution part that is why we assume that in this case the program is bounded on CPU.

3. Could you improve the partitioning of your data to yield better run-time?

#WordCount.java
	No. Increasing parallelism resulted in worse runtime. Program is network bonded and parallelization in data reading by multiple workers won't help either due to communication overhead.

#CellCluster.java
	No. Increasing parallelism resulted in worse runtime. It also made the program network bonded instead of CPU.
	Another way in which we that could achieve better runtime might be increasing input file - berlin to germany and then increasing parallelism. We conducted such experiment and the results are similar to the expected.
